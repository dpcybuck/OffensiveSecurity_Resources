Infosystir named me your hacker secret santa.  You left your address off of the form.  Which I now have, and I will send you something to open.  
Before I got the address i decided that your gift would be a donation to a charity in your name.  So, I donated to North Wind Farms.  
I hope you like it.  I did it through a sight called greatnonprofits and North wind might get the check this week...but it might not be until
next month.  Not sure.  https://greatnonprofits.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/8000062861-how-would-i-know-if-the-nonprofit-already-received-my-donation-

http://www.northwindfarm.org

Here is the donation information I got back from the sight.  Its the closest thing I have that i can "give" you, showing there is a donation in your name.

And like i said, you'll get an actual gift to open either this week or next.  Not because I delayed...just because it took me a while to go from 
what you put on the form to infosystir and the actual address.

I don't find myself in Texas much, and maybe I'll see you at a con in the Austion or San Antonio area.

Have a merry christmas,
David
